# Text-Classification
This repository is a Java project that showcases the power and versatility of the generic collections and the collection framework in Java.
The project includes two main components: an iterable histogram class and a text analysis class.

In order to see the implementation of the classes in action, run the HashMapHistogramTester.java and FileIndexTester.java files.

## The iterable histogram class:
Implements a histogram data structure using generic collections.

A histogram is a representation of data that groups data into bins and displays the frequency of data within each bin.

The histogram class allows for the creation of histograms for any type of data, and it can be used to easily display and analyze data distributions.

## The text analysis class:
A tool that analyzes text files and identifies the most significant words in each text. It then sorts the texts according to their verbal similarity, which is calculated using the TF-IDF technique.
The TF-IDF technique is a widely used technique in text analysis that measures the importance of a word in a document relative to the entire collection of documents.
The text analysis class provides a practical application of the collection framework, as it uses various collections to store and manipulate the data.

This repository is an excellent resource for those looking to learn and practice the use of generic collections and the collection framework in Java.
This project provides a hands-on opportunity to learn and apply generic collections and the collection framework in real-world scenarios.
